          <p class="major">
            On a stormy night, a soaked puppy sees something impossible:
            a tiny life clinging to a drifting plastic bottle, fighting not to
            disappear. This is the moment that gave birth to Pawthways.

            This is not just a sad video for your feed. It is the emotional
            spine behind Pawthways: abandonment, fear, instinct, and the choice
            to fight for one more life.

              A red leash on wet asphalt. Footsteps walking away. An engine
              starting. We never see the face. We don’t need to. Someone decided
              this puppy no longer mattered.

            <p>
              In the rain, the puppy trembles. Cars pass. Headlights blur
              around him. He waits in the exact place where he was left, still
              expecting the person who is not coming back.

              The street dissolves into a flooded river. The puppy reaches the
              edge, soaked and exhausted. Then he sees it: a plastic bottle
              spinning in the current, with something small clinging to it.

                We use powerful storytelling to open hearts: abandonment, fear,
